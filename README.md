# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

In this assignment, I grabbed data from USGS to get JSON object of earthquake data.
Earthquake data included date, latitude, longitude and magnitude of earthquake.

I visualized these metrics using the leaflet.js library.

The map has 4 layer: High Contrast, Street, Dark, and Satellite. By clicking on the icon in the top right, one can select the layer to view.
The magnitude of each earthquake determines the radius of each circle. Clicking on the circle will provide attribute data for the each earthquake.
